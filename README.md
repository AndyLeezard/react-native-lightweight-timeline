# Overview
React Native Just Timeline is a package intended to provide an elegant, highly flexible and customizable, performant solution to render a sequence of events, taking in mind the support for RTL orientation and the package was developed with that concern in mind.
So, this package has the following as its major concerns:
1. Support for RTL
2. Clean design
3. Flexibility to customize that design
4. Perfomance, by providing the ability to lazy-load
5. Lightweight

# Installation
The installation for the Timeline itself is pretty straightforward, just:
```javascript
npm install react-native-just-timeline
```

However, ```react-native-vector-icons``` is internally used to provided the icons, so you'll have to make sure it's correctly installed in your project and properly linked, or otherwise, **an error would pretty much occur**, e.g. _Unable to resolve 'FontAwesome'_.
